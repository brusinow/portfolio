      Hi, my name is Brent and I am a creative-minded, solutions-driven software developer with a passion for intuitive design and function. My previous experience as a full-time touring musician informs everything that I do: from my ability to adapt and adjust plans quickly to finding efficient, concise solutions for challenging problems. My work ethic is reflected in my work, whether I am collaborating with my team to execute thoughtful user experiences or working on my own web-based passion projects.

      For the past five years I got to experience the wild ride of touring 250+ days a year with soul singer Allen Stone - appearing on all the major late night TV shows, headlining global tours, and opening for artists ranging from Stevie Wonder to Macklemore to Dave Matthews Band. Music still plays an important role in my life, as well as the habits and skills I learned through it: maintaining a disciplined routine, developing an ability to deal with ambiguity, and working toward mastering my craft.

      Currently, I live in Ballard with my wife and our dog and cat. Together, we spend our spare time exploring our city, digging through record stores, and venturing out to Seattle’s trendy restaurants.
